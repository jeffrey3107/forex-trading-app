This is a DevSecOps demo for a simple Forex trading application using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), integrating Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Jenkins, and SonarQube. The goal is to demonstrate the importance of security practices in DevOps operations, using SonarQube to identify and address vulnerabilities before deploying the app to Kubernetes. I’ll adapt the scenario to a Forex trading app (e.g., a Python Flask app for tracking currency rates and trading signals), ensuring it’s accessible and manageable in VS Code.
